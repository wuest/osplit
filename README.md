## Unnamed splits project

This is an extremely barebones very hacky start - this will ultimately be
integrated with my [stream overlay tools (soon to be renamed)][overlay0].  For
now, this is just barely functional enough to share with people who want a look,
though it's very rough around the edges.  Once this project is integrated with
the overall stream tools I maintain, expect this repository to disappear.

Much of the code is not fully tied in yet; this is still _heavily_ work in
progress.
